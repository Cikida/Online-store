            <p class="aboutsection">Humi Boutique was founded in 1886 by Gabrielle Chanel. She lived her life as she
                alone intended. The trials of a childhood as an orphan and the successes of an accomplished
                businesswoman gave birth to an extraordinary character; daring, free, and ahead of her time. Faithful
                friendships and passionate love affairs, as well as a thirst for culture, discovery and travel helped
                shaped her personality. A wardrobe freed from constraints and superfluity, tweaked with masculine
                accents, created a visionary allure that has become timeless and yet wildly modern. Pearls and diamonds
                casually paired with iconic perfumes have created a signature style... That of an avant-garde woman, a
                pioneer whose lifestyle and multiple facets forged the values of the House she founded, and who remains
                an inspiration for all women. (adapted from the <a
